# 🔋 Battery Thermal Management System using Thermoelectric Cooling

This project is focused on designing a thermal management system for lithium-ion battery packs using a **thermoelectric cooling system (TEC)**, **forced air cooling**, and **Arduino-based control**. It ensures the battery pack operates within safe temperature limits to extend lifespan and improve efficiency.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time temperature monitoring with LM35
- Automatic control of TEC and fan using Arduino
- Compact and cost-effective solution
- Visual indicators for different operating states (Green, Red)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Green** → Normal operation (safe temperature)
- **Red** → Critical overheat, immediate action required
